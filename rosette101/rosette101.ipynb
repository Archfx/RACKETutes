    "Rosette is a solver-aided programming language that leverages the powerful [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) solver, alongside techniques from formal verification and symbolic execution. It provides a unique approach to programming by integrating a solver into the programming process, allowing for the exploration of program behaviors, automatic bug finding, and even program synthesis. With Rosette, developers can write programs that include symbolic values and assertions, enabling the solver to reason about program properties and detect potential issues. The solver can analyze concrete and symbolic values, identify failure-inducing inputs, and even generate repairs for faulty expressions. Additionally, Rosette supports angelic execution, where the solver searches for inputs that satisfy program requirements. By leveraging the power of solvers, Rosette empowers developers to write more reliable and robust software while automating tasks traditionally requiring manual effort and expertise in formal methods. Lets go through example use cases provided in the [Rosette documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/rosette-guide/index.html)."

    "> Note: Rosette's symbolic evaluation engine operates on the program states. Instead of operating on one path at a time, it keeps track of all assumptions and assertions in the path at the beginning.  This is done through the `verification` condition (VC)`.  During the tutorial, we will be switching contexts between different examples and problems. Since we are using the same kernel to run different examples, we need to clean the VC when we switch the context."

    "In conclusion, the Rosette tutorial has provided a comprehensive introduction to the powerful features and capabilities of this solver-aided programming language. Through its integration with the Z3 solver and the utilization of formal verification and symbolic execution techniques, Rosette empowers developers to write more reliable and robust software. By incorporating symbolic values, assertions, and the ability to reason about program properties, Rosette enables the automatic detection of bugs, generation of program repairs, and even angelic execution to find inputs that meet specific requirements. The tutorial has equipped programmers with the knowledge and tools to leverage Rosette's unique approach, unlocking new possibilities for software development and verification. With Rosette, developers can enhance their programming workflows, improve code quality, and tackle complex problems more effectively. As they continue to explore and apply the concepts and techniques covered in the tutorial, developers can confidently embrace the potential of Rosette to build innovative and dependable software solutions."
