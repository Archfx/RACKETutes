    "Previously we looked at the verification of Verilog hardware implementations. In this post, we will be looking at the verification of firmware or systems code. Here the hardware implementation is abstracted with Instruction Level Abstraction (ILA). This allows us to make complex verification problems more tractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "ILAS refers to a level of abstraction in computer systems design and analysis that focuses on the behavior and functionality of individual instructions within a processor or microarchitecture. It involves representing and reasoning about instructions as fundamental units of computation, abstracting away lower-level details and complexities. At the instruction level, the emphasis is on understanding the functionality and effects of instructions, including their operation, data flow, dependencies, and control flow. ILA provides a higher-level perspective that allows for the analysis of programs and systems without getting into the intricacies of the underlying hardware implementation."

We can define the ILA for the processor that your firmware is built for, with Serval. Then, we can compile the firmware, obtain the binary and using Serval we can uplift the systems code into Racket supporting syntaxes. There are few things to note here, Serval does not support concurrent codes and codes with unbounded loops. I don't think these are limitations, since as verification engineers, we need to be creative to solve these kinds of issues."
